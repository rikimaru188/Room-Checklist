# Isaac Room Checklist

## Description

Keeps track of all the rooms you have visited throughout the current save files journey. It will display "New Room" next to the health bar for when a new room has been visited.

## Getting Started

The mod can be found here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114670457

### Restrictions

* Will only keep track of individual saves. 
* Any previously explored rooms before the mod was installed will not be considered. It will be a blank slate.

## Plans for the future
* Create a GUI that you will be able to manually mark rooms as visited
* Allow for all save files to share rooms visited
